Object detection code / models/ experiments/ results for AI for Healthcare 01.116 module based off of yolov5

healthcare.ipynb has script to invoke training code for training models by invoking the train.py
testing and inference is also done on this notebook by invoking the test.py and detect.py 

The image preprocessing is done on slicer.py

Note, several experiments were conducted however only some were included in the repo as it occupied too much space.
